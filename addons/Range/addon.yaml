    # functions, strings, numbers, and custom define default slots for this
    # proto, which are available before executing scripts.
    functions:
      # Each CFunction has an fn attribute that is the name of the Go function
      # to use, and an optional tag attribute that overrides the DefaultTag
      # setting for that function.

    # custom:
      # custom contains any slots other than CFunctions, strings, and numbers
      # that can and should be set up at compile time. Each slot is of the form
      # `slot: <literal Go code>`,
      # e.g. `readBuffer: 'vm.NewSequence([]byte{}, true, "latin1")'.
    value: "Range{}"
depends:
  # Depends contains the list of addons to import before executing any scripts.
install:
  # install contains slots to install on existing Core or Addon protos. E.g. we
  # could do something like:
  #
  #   - proto: Number
  #     tag: NumberTag
  #     functions:
  #       toBy: {fn: ToBy}
  #
  # The value field is ignored.
scripts:
  # scripts contains the list of Io scripts that should be executed after
  # initializing the protos but before completing the import. The scripts are
  # executed in order of their appearance here. The evaluation target for each
  # script is vm.Addons instead of vm.Lobby. Each script has its text
  # compressed and copied into the generated plugin source code.
