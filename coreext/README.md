Package coreext sets up "optional" components of the iolang core.

These packages may be imported for side effects only in order to make their functionality available on all VMs. Many, but not all, provide additional functionality (e.g. type definitions and constructors) that may be useful for adding values when embedding or for developing addons.

Importing package coreext directly transitively sets up all core extensions.
